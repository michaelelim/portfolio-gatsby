## Hi there

My name is Michael.  I have a wonderful family of 4, and my life goal is their happiness.

I understand that in order to make strides in my career, I must constantly learning, because there will always be a new technology, skill or technique.  If you aren't learning, you may be left behind.

Thus, in addition to having a portfolio that you are currently reading, I made this version specifically to learn the basics of Gatsby.

I also made a Wordpress version (to learn the basics of wordpress) here:

- Project Management

As of this date (2020-10-07) my tech stack is as follows:

- Javascript
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express

And thanks to Panr (who created this Starter), I am learning Gatsby!

So, there you have it... thanks for reading!
