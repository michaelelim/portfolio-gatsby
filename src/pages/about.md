## Hi there

My name is Michael and I'm the author of this portfolio. 

I made it in order to learn the basics of Gatsby.

I understand that the life of a web developer is that of constant learning, because there will always be a new programming language, extension, or technique.  If you don't constantly learn, you may be left behind.

As of this date (2020-09-16) I am comfortable with the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Javascript
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express
- Websockets
- Socket.io
- DOM and Web APIs
- MySQL
- Git

And thanks to Panr (who created this Starter), I am learning Gatsby!

So, there you have it... thanks for reading!
