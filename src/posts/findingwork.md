In the world of Covid without a vaccine, there are many challenges that we face
in the pursuit of that shiny new career.  

Below is a list of 5 challenges that we face:

| Challenges                         |  Difficulty Level  |  Time Cost    |
| ---------------------------------- | :----------------: | :-----------: |
| Lack of experience                 |      Medium        |  Negligible   |
| Lack of practical knowledge        |      Low           |  Negligible   |
| Larger supply of candidates        |      High          |  High         |
| Low demand for fresh candidates    |      Medium        |  High         |
| Difficult employment market        |      Very High     |  Very High    |

**Please note that the difficulty levels change with the amount of knowledge, experience, and confidence**. To be a great candidate, you have to continually learn new technologies and skills, otherwise you'll fall behind, and eventually be surpassed by other candidates who have kept up to date on the new technologies that become the mainstay tools of the trade.  

> One of the most important tips is to utilize your previous experience in the hunt for jobs. You need to give yourself the biggest advantage, and the previous experiences will give solace to companies that you have transferable skills.  Of course, if you have NO experience at all, then you need to start somewhere (anywhere) that will take you, even if its on a voluntary basis. That experience will be invaluable on your resume for future applications, or alternatively you can prove yourself with the voluntary position, where they would give you a promotion to a paid role.

- Lack of experience - Their loss.  Just keep searching, while continuing to learn on the side, or take a volunteering role, so that you can gain the experience.
- Lack of knowledge - Up to you to fix.  The continual pursuit of knowledge never ends.  If you refuse to learn more, then you can't make it in another company unless you freelance.  
- Larger supply of candidates - #covidproblems.  We're competing against more experienced and more knowledgable candidates at this time.  It will take even more resiliance in this climate to find that job.  Don't get down on yourself.  Continue to go after it!
- Lower demand for fresh candidates - #covidproblems.  Companies are less likely to look for fresh candidates to mold at this time.  You need to gain knowledge and experience any way you can so that you will eventually stand out, and won't be that fresh developer.
- Difficult employment market - #covidproblems.  Companies have to tighten their spending during this uncertain job market.  Look for any type of job that has the possibility of moving into your preferred role.  Take a job that has a that specific department, and ask to work on your preferences on the side or on your spare time.  You can do it!  You just have to hussle.  

Hopefully these thoughts help in your job hunt. But the most important thing is not to give up. The only way to find a job is to continually improve yourself, and continually apply.  Otherwise, companies will never know of your talents.
