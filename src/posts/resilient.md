After a few months of not finding a job, it can become a mental battle. 

![Coding and Watching the Game to Relax](../images/codingbasketball.jpg)

You can start to lose faith in your process, and question whether you should make changes to everything you're trying to accomplish.  

Perhaps I should change my:
- Resume
- Cover Letter
- Sites where I look for jobs
- Jobs that I apply for
- Frequency of applications I send
- Frequency of attempts to contact people in my network
- Frequency of speaking to advisors

**It is important to reassess your process, get advice from people, and make changes if it makes sense.**

However, do not make any rash decisions!  It is entirely possible that your lack of finding a job is out of your control.  Perhaps there's a terrible disease called COVID, that is making a job market especially tough?  

Most importantly, you have to build resiliency to draughts.  

Have someone you can get advice from, whether it's family, a friend, or a mentor.
Take a mental break, because it can be daunting to think about finding a job at every waking moment.
Finally, always believe in yourself.  Once you stop believing, you can't put your best foot forward, and you will make the job hunt even more difficult. 

Good luck, and be resilient!
