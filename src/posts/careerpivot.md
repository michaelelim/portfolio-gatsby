It can very difficult to take the plunge and leave your current career path and explore other career choices.

Before taking the leap, you have to ensure that your life is in order.  

In particular, you should have the following in your life:
- 6+ months of savings 
- Grounded headspace
- Household buy-in
- No big ticket purchases on the horizon

**It is important to ensure that all this is in order, or you may lose everything in pursuit of your new career.**

As in every decision you make, do not make any rash decisions!  It is entirely possible that your lack of finding a job is out of your control.  Perhaps there's a terrible disease called COVID, that is making a job market especially tough?  

Most importantly, you have to build resiliency to draughts.  

Have someone you can get advice from, whether it's family, a friend, or a mentor.
Take a mental break, because it can be daunting to think about finding a job at every waking moment.
Finally, always believe in yourself.  Once you stop believing, you can't put your best foot forward, and you will make the job hunt even more difficult. 

Good luck, and be resilient!
