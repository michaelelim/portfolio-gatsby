Pitching yourself in the time it takes to get to your floor
on an elevator is a skill that can be honed.
Like everything in life, it takes practice, practice, practice.


## First, distill your skills into a maximum of 5 points.

These are the main skills I bring to the table (and note that I list 4):
1. Financial Industry Experience
2. Process Management
3. Web Development
4. Digital Marketing

## Second, create talking points for each skill.

For example, my achievement of designing the Intranet to cater to a company of 600+ employees would be great talking point for a company that's building their CRM.

Or my capstone project, You Don't Know Diddly Squat, would be a great talking point for a company that creates games.

## Finally, practice your pitch... out loud... in front of someone!

Your preparedness is great on paper, but you'll find that you may stumble in finding the right path in your pitch when you're actually put in the situation where you need to speak about yourself to someone.

I hope that these tips can help you!  Just be sure to keep working hard because won't find that job if you don't put in the time and effort.
